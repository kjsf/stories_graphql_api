# Stories (GraphQL API)

**Its like twitter but (stories) long.**

_This app was created to practice back-end skills with Phoenix, Ecto and GraphQL._

### To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with
```console
mix deps.get
```
  * Create and migrate your database with
```console
mix ecto.setup
```
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with
```console
mix phx.server
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/api/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/api/graphiql) from your browser to test the API.
